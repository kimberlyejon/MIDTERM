        <p style="padding: 32px;">
            Starting my first year in BSIT, I expected to learn about coding, networks, and all things IT. I thought it would be not challenging, but as long as you study hard and you love the subjects you eventually make it. I even meet so many good people and friends we helping each other and we tackled assignments and projects together. I learned a lot from them because we have a different experiences. Yup its a lot fun.

Looking into the future in the IT industry, I imagine myself working on cool projects and finding my comfort, whether it's coding or something else exciting. I know I'll have to keep learning because tech never stops evolving.
